# CIS-5430---DATABASES-AND-DATA-WAREHOUSING

**Project Overview: Footwear Products e-Store Database**

**Introduction**

The project aims to support the operations of an online footwear store, providing a robust database solution for product management, customer information, order processing, and inventory management.

**Purpose**

The primary goal of the project is to establish effective and reliable data management for the e-store. 
This involves creating tables with proper constraints to store product information, customer data, and order details while ensuring data quality and security. 
Additionally, the database is designed to manage inventory, keeping real-time track of available stock as orders are placed and fulfilled.
This project also focuses on improving data retrieval and reporting capabilities. 
By defining views that offer meaningful insights into sales, order tracking, and customer analytics, the database aims to enhance decision-making for store management. 
The project incorporates complex SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, group by, and clauses, to extract valuable insights from the data.

**Functionalities**

The documentation for the Footwear Products online shop database provides detailed information about entity types, relationships, and properties. 
This assists users in understanding how data is organized and stored in the database. 
Data validation rules and constraints are also described to ensure accuracy and consistency, defining data types, allowable values, and business rules for incoming data.

The project emphasizes the following functionalities:

Efficient Inventory Management: The database is designed to efficiently handle inventory management, allowing the e-store to monitor stock levels, track sales, and automatically update inventory in real time.

Comprehensive Product Data: Accurate and comprehensive product data is crucial for a good user experience. The database includes all relevant information about each product, such as size, color, materials, price, and availability.

**Users and Roles**

The system caters to various users with distinct roles:

Customers: Place orders, view product information, and track order status.

Employees: Process orders, manage inventory, and update product details.

Administrators: Oversee the entire database, ensuring data integrity and security.

**Project 1**

**Conceptual and Logical Design**

Business Rules: The team identified and implemented business rules to govern the behavior of the database, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

Entity and Relationship Types: A comprehensive analysis led to the identification of entity and relationship types, forming the basis for the database design.

ER/EER Diagram: Using software tools, an Entity-Relationship (ER/EER) diagram was created, visually representing the structure and connections within the database.

**Database Logical Design**

Join Paths and Referential Integrity: Join paths were established for the relational database, ensuring referential integrity and efficient data retrieval.

Function Analysis: Each table underwent function analysis, defining the purpose and operations associated with it.

Normalization: The database was normalized, and all normalized tables were presented, indicating the normalization form for each table. Tables in 2NF and 3NF were also highlighted.

**Group Project 2**

SQL DDL Script (Database Creation Script) - provided a comprehensive SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) script for creating the database.

Database Structure/Relational Schema - The structure of the database, including the relational schema for each table, was detailed using DESC TableName commands.

Database Instance - A snapshot of the database instance was presented using SELECT * FROM TableName commands, showcasing sample data.

Data Manipulation Statements

Insert Values: The team provided examples of INSERT statements for adding data to the database.

Update Values: Examples of UPDATE statements for modifying existing data were presented.

Delete Values: DELETE statements were outlined for removing data from the database.

Create View: Views were created to facilitate data retrieval based on specific requirements.

SQL Select Statements

Demonstrated advanced SQL SELECT statements, including joins, subqueries, GROUP BY, HAVING, and function statements.

PL/SQL Statement Block

PL/SQL statement blocks were used to construct business logic and process data efficiently.

Object Types Usage

Object types were employed for object columns or object tables, showcasing a versatile approach to data representation.

Lessons Learned

Throughout the project, the team gained valuable insights into database design, SQL scripting, and collaboration. 

The importance of efficient inventory management, accurate data representation, and thoughtful normalization became evident. 

The team also honed their skills in using Oracle SQL and implementing complex queries to meet the diverse needs of an online footwear store.

**Result**

The Footwear Products e-Store Database developed by Group 1 of CIS-5430 serves as a testament to effective collaboration and a thorough understanding of database design principles. 

The project addresses the key requirements of an online footwear store, providing a scalable, optimized, and well-documented database system that streamlines operations and supports business activities effectively.
